## GUI Library written in the D Programming Language based on SFML

Original dsfml source here: https://github.com/Jebbs/DSFML

This library is still under development and is not yet "usable".
It's open for contributins though, thank you!

It'll be a light-weight, easy to use and functional library to get things done!
