///A module containing the Time struct
module dsfml.system.time;

import std.traits;

/**
 *Represents a time value
 *
 *The Time struct encapsulates a time value in a flexible way.
 *
 *It allows to define a time value either as a number of seconds, milliseconds or microseconds. It also works the other way round: you can read a time value as either a number of seconds, milliseconds or microseconds.
 *
 *By using such a flexible interface, the API doesn't impose any fixed type or resolution for time values, and let the user choose its own favorite representation.
 *
 *Time values support the usual mathematical operations: you can add or subtract two times, multiply or divide a time by a number, compare two times, etc.
 *
 *Since they represent a time span and not an absolute time value, times can also be negative.
