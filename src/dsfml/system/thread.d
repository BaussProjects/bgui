 *Utility class to manipulate threads.
 *
 *Threads provide a way to run multiple parts of the code in parallel.
 *
 *When you launch a new thread, the execution is split and both the new thread and the caller run in parallel. 
 *
 *To use a Thread, you construct it directly with the function to execute as the entry point of the thread.
